Work Filter is a small ruby script to add the contents of sites_list.txt to /etc/hosts point at localhost so they can't be accessed during productive time, and then remove them when not being productive.

Usage:
To turn the filter on, enter 'sudo ruby workfilter.rb' or 'sudo ruby workfilter.rb on', and then enter your password into the prompt.

To turn the filter off, enter 'sudo ruby workfilter.rb off', and then enter your password into the prompt.

If you want to change the list of web sites blocked, edit the contents of sites_list.txt
